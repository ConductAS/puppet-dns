This is the Puppet DNS module. It uses the Fog Ruby library to interface with
your DNS service hosted zone.

NOTE: Currently only Amazon Web Services (AWS) is supported.

Example:

    dnszone {
        "example.net.":
            ensure => "present",
            id     => 'my_api_key_id',
            secret => 'my_secret_api_key';
    }
